# TG-ReDial
We released a topic-guided conversational recommendation dataset for research on conversational/interactive recommender systems: TG-ReDial v1.0. First, it incorporates topic threads to enforce natural semantic transitions towards the recommendation scenario. Second, it is created in a semi-automatic way, hence human annotation is more reasonable and controllable.
